/*
 * Secondary role driver's purpose is to deal with deciding whether primary action
 * or secondary role of a key should be used. It also does some auxiliary work, but
 * it does not carry out the actions. Once the primary/secondary question has been
 * decided, actions are carried out as usual in usb_report updater.
 *
 * Resolution roughly goes as as this:
 * - start in DontKnowYet state
 * - initiate postponer - from this point on, all keypresses are queued rather than executed
 * - look into postponer queue for as long as needed
 * - when decided, change to the corresponding state and activate the corresponding role
 * - once postponer's cycles_until_activation reach zero, postponer itself will start replaying
 *   the affected keys (e.g., action keys on a "secondary" layer)
